# MP2RAGElib (Work in progress...)
I have started this project to understand MP2RAGE more deeply by implementing Marques et al. (2010) myself. There are other implementations but I think this one is unique in the following ways:

1. It is Python.
2. It is minimalist by design (only using functions, and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) as a core dependency).
3. The functions have extensive documentation in their docstrings.
4. It is build to teach the details of MP2RAGE T1 mapping (first to myself and maybe in the future to others :) ).
5. [TODO] It has a simple command-line interface for users with no programming or Python experience.
